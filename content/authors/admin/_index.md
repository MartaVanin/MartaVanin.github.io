I am an incoming assistant professor (starting October, 2024) in the [Electa](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/electa) group of the [KU Leuven - Technologiecampus Gent](https://www.kuleuven.be/gent/industrieel-ingenieur), which is part of the department of electrical engineering [(ESAT)](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be) of KU Leuven, as well as [EnergyVille](https://energyville.be/). Prior to that, I have been a postdoc and a PhD student at Electa (Leuven) and EnergyVille, in prof. [Dirk Van Hertem](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/electa/professors/00043846)'s group. During my PhD and postdoc time, I visited the Zuse Institute in Berlin, Germany, and CSIRO Energy in Newcastle (NSW), Australia, for a few months.

> :loudspeaker: I have an opening for a Ph.D. student, do not hesitate to contact me if interested ❗

## Research interests

I am interested in (developing) computational tools and methods for pretty much all-things (electricity) distribution system modelling and optimization. In particular, my main interests and expertise lie in the exploitation of digital measurements to achieve a better understanding of the network state and physical properties, as well as the development of solutions that improve current network management practices. As a general rule, I favor exact methods, unless there really is a strong case for approximations or heuristics, and solutions that are applicable to generic real-life distribution networks.

Presently, my main research activities include: 
- system monitoring, through state estimation, 
- system identification/parameter estimation either in (near-)real-time or with historical data,
- optimal asset management to increase the penetration of renewable energy resources without causing congestion,
- technical and policy considerations on smart meters and their capabilities,
- "digital twins".

Check my publications on google scholar (link below) for a better overview of my research activities/expertise.
If you would like to collaborate on something - even if it slightly deviates from the topics above -, or if you would like to ask about PhD/postdoc positions, just send me an e-mail to check mutual interest and time availability.
